FEWD2 Team Project - Framework
John and Dee worked on the project today. 
We decided on categories for the styles we need to create
and then made small demonstration HTML files for each of the categories.
These are the files:
    buttons.html
    forms.html
    grid.html
    images.html
    lists.html
    tables.html
    text.html
    typography.html
 Then we divided the CSS file in segments separated by comments
that indicated which styles should go where.
We put in media queries with three breakpoints and gave each view
a background color just to make sure the queries were working.
We added some beginning typographic styles (H1-H6), based on rems, 
and increaed the sizes at the second breakpoint.
FInally, we worked on the text.html page and created most ofthe classes
that we need, like .italic  or .underline.
John is now working on buttons and I'm working on forms.
