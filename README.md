FEWD2 Team Project - Framework
May 18. I uploaded new versions of all the files, standardizing the info in the head, adding more material to the grid.html demo page and also adding grid classes. On the grid.html page I put temporary colored borders around the rows and columns just so you can see what is happening. John is putting the final touches on buttons. In the head, I put the link to google fonts and favicons first, then the link to the reset, and then the link to our stylesheet and then scripts. I think that's the recommended order.

May17. John and Dee worked on the project today. 
We decided on categories for the styles we need to create
and then made small demonstration HTML files for each of the categories.
These are the files:
    buttons.html
    forms.html
    grid.html
    images.html
    lists.html
    tables.html
    text.html
    typography.html
 Then we divided the CSS file in segments separated by comments
that indicated which styles should go where.
We put in media queries with three breakpoints and gave each view
a background color just to make sure the queries were working.
We added some beginning typographic styles (H1-H6), based on rems, 
and increaed the sizes at the second breakpoint.
FInally, we worked on the text.html page and created most ofthe classes
that we need, like .italic  or .underline.
John is now working on buttons and I'm working on forms.
